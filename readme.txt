WARNING! This is the beta-testing version of the Twitoaster Plugin. Tests are not finished yet. Please use the [Stable Twitoaster Plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitoaster/) for the moment.

Here is how Twitter Replies / Twitter Updates work:

1. You Post an article on your blog
2. You update your Twitter status (or let the plugin do it for you)
3. You automatically get all related Twitter Replies as comments to your Post

The plugin also brings two widgets:

1. Analytics charts showing how many Twitter Replies you are receiving
2. Listings of your 20 most recent Twitter Conversations

4. Go to the `Settings` -> `Twitoaster` to manage options (Twitter Replies, Twitter Status updates, Twitter Charts...)
